        # 🚨 SECURITY VULNERABILITY REPORT

        **DO NOT CREATE PUBLIC ISSUES FOR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

        This template is for awareness only. Please use our secure reporting process instead.

        ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

        **This is NOT the correct way to report security vulnerabilities.**

        Public GitHub issues are visible to everyone and may put users at risk. Please follow our [responsible disclosure policy](https://github.com/lucien-vallois/adversarial-phish-forge/blob/master/SECURITY.md) instead.

        ### Correct Reporting Channels:

        **Email:** security@chimera-project.org
        **PGP Key Fingerprint:** `8F3B 2C8A 9E1D 4F7C 2B5A 6D9E 1F4A 8C3B 7E2F 5D1A`

        ### Why Private Reporting?
        - Protects other users from exploitation
        - Allows time for proper remediation
        - Maintains responsible disclosure standards
        - Enables coordinated vulnerability management
